# What's next?

This workshop is just the beginning of your Substrate and Polkadot development experience. There is still a ton more to do before you become an expert!

* Add more features to the Substrate Kitties Pallet:
	* Add the ability to breed kitties to create new ones which combine DNA of the parents.
	* Add the ability to generate kitties in the genesis block of your blockchain.
	* Use your kitty's DNA to give it other stats which can be used to play games your program, like racing or combat.
* Build your own custom front-end for this Kitties Pallet using [Polkadot JS](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/).
* Add other FRAME Pallets to your Runtime:
	* Check out just some of the Pallets Parity has built here: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame
